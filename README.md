## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap
- Materializecss


### What I learned
Materializecss come with built in customisation. The card are curved on the edge. It's easy to work with if you a quicker way to design your UI but it has limitation. It is not as big as bootstrap.

### Continued development
Building a project from scratch with a wire frame as guide I will use materializecss but for project with a mockup/prototype I will continue using Bootstrap.
